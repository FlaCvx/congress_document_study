    "text_one=\"that it is impossible to know the extent of the\\nevil, or provide a remedy. If these facts and\\narguments are sufficient to produce doubts in\\ngentlemen's minds, they will hesitate in con-\\ncurring with the committee in this article of the\\nreport; for, in cases of uncertainty, I take it to\\nbe the wisest way not to proceed in a dubious\\ntrack.\\nMr. GERRY.--After what I said yesterday on\\nthis subject, it cannot be necessary for me to\\ngo again fully into the argument; what I then\\nadvanced has been answered in few cases. I\\nmentioned the difficulties to which a merchant\\nwould be subjected who would have to advance\\nthe duties; he must sell to a loss, or have a large\\ncapital for the purpose; no argument has been\\nurged to show an impropriety in this reasoning.\\ncargo and outfits of a vessel worth £1000,\\nlaw ful money, would bring in return 22,000 gal.\\ntons of molasses; this, as I said yesterday, will\\npay £396, a duty of near forty per cent upon\\nThe cargo. It was also mentioned, that a large\\nquantity of the article was used by the poor of\\nthe seaports; a high duty must necessarily raise\\nthe pricu or lessen the consumption, in which\\ncase it will be an additional discouragement to\\nthe trade. If the price is raised, the distiller\\nmust likewise increase his capital or manufac-\\nture less, if so, the demand is again decreased.\\nIf it is necessary to destroy the manufacture\\non account of the injury it does to the tnorals\\nof the people, the proprietors ought to be in.\\ndemnified. But if rum is still to be used among\\nug, let us give a preference to our own manu-\\nfacture. By discouraging the molasses trade,\\nyou lessen the demand for fish, which are ex-\\nported to be exchanged for that article.\\nIt has been said, that a fisherman uses but\\ntwelve gallons. I include his family, and make\\nit thirty; for this he has to pay two dollars an-\\nnually. Is not this a burthen? Gentlemen must\\nown it is..\\nThe gentleman from Virginia refers us to a\\nperiod before the revolution, when the inanu.\\nfacture supported itself under a duty. The\\nkingdom of Great Britain was at that tine in\\nthe zenith of her power; she had her board of\\ncommerce, her vessels of war, and bodies of\\ntroops to support the measure; she sent over an\\narmy before she gave it up; at last she was com-\\npelled to reduce it. But do gentlemen mean to\\nengage Congress to support its measures in this\\nway. The Parliament had an object to contend\\nfor; they did notlike their New England colonies\\nto interfere with the business of their West India\\nislands; they wished totally to destroy our dis-\\ntilleries, but could not succeed. This Govern-\\nment has no object of this kind; then shall we\\ngive chagrin to those people of whom we exact\\nsupport? Are we not putting to hazard the af-\\nfections of the numerous citizens concerned in\\nthis business, who have been the wart adyo-\\ncates of the Constitution from an expectation\\nof benefit to their particular interests? And this\\nfor the sake of a measure that must decat il\\nsell. The duty will exceed the risk of smug.\\n\"\n",
